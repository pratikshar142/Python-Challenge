## **Python Challenge**
Using Python to work on 2 different Excel datasets.

## **Introduction**
There are 2 different assignments PyBank and PyPoll. The input files exists in 'Resources' folder and the output files are placed in 'Analysis' folder.
The projects are done using basic python libraries like os,csv and sys .

##  Assignment- PyBank  ##

Python script is written to analyze the financial records of a company. Given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
